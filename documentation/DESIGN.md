# Design and Assumptions

This document outlines the design principles and assumptions made during the development of the LOTR API.

## Design Principles

1. **SOLID Principles**: The project adheres to SOLID principles to ensure maintainability and extensibility.

2. **RESTful Design**: The API follows RESTful principles for resource naming and HTTP method usage.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: The project structure separates different concerns (e.g., controllers, models, services) for better organization and maintainability.

4. **Dependency Injection**: Used to manage dependencies and facilitate testing.

5. **Repository Pattern**: Implemented to abstract data access logic.

## Assumptions

1. **High Demand**: The API is designed assuming it will face high demand, similar to production environments in the target job.

2. **Scalability**: While the current implementation uses a single database, the design allows for easy scaling (e.g., read replicas, sharding) in the future.

3. **Performance**: Caching mechanisms are implemented assuming frequent reads and less frequent writes.

4. **Security**: Basic security measures are implemented, assuming the API will be publicly accessible.

5. **Extensibility**: The codebase is designed to be easily extendable for future features or additional LOTR-related resources.

6. **Consistency**: Data consistency is prioritized, assuming this is critical for the application's use case.

7. **Internationalization**: The current implementation is in English, but the design allows for easy addition of multiple languages in the future.

## Trade-offs

1. **Simplicity vs. Feature Completeness**: Given the project's scope, some advanced features (e.g., full-text search) are not implemented but are considered in the design for future addition.

2. **Performance vs. Flexibility**: Some design choices prioritize performance (e.g., denormalization) while maintaining a balance with data flexibility.

3. **Strict Typing vs. Development Speed**: PHP 8.1's strict typing is used to catch errors early, even though it might slightly slow down initial development.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application code
  - `config/`: Configuration files
  - `logs/`: Application logs
  - `opt/`: Optional scripts and database files
  - `src/`: Source code
    - `Controllers/`: API endpoint controllers
    - `Models/`: Data models
    - `Repositories/`: Data access layer
    - `Services/`: Business logic
    - `Middleware/`: Request/response middleware
    - `Formatters/`: Response formatters
  - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
  - `vendor/`: Composer dependencies
- `database/`: Database-related files
  - `migrations/`: Database migration files
  - `seeds/`: Database seeder files
- `documentation/`: Project documentation files
- `docker/`: Docker-related files
- `public/`: Publicly accessible files
  - `index.php`: Entry point for the application
  - `swagger/`: Swagger UI files for API documentation

This structure organizes the code for easy navigation and maintenance, separating concerns and following best practices for PHP application development.

These design choices and assumptions aim to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable API that meets the requirements of a high-demand production environment while allowing for future growth and modifications.
